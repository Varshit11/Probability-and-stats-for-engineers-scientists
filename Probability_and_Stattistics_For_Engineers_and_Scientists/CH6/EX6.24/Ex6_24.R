# Weibull Distribution Problem..

# given X is weibull distribution with alpha = 0.01 and beta = 2
# to find P(X < 8)

cat("The probability that life of X falls before 8 hours of usge is",pweibull(8,shape = 2,scale = sqrt(100)))

# Note - Chapter 7 contains only theoretical problems, so I am not solving that chapter, the chapter contains 7 problems total and all are theoretical with nothing or very less to compute anything..
# I will start with 8th Chapter..
